# Readable

A project built in fulfillment of Udacity's React Developer nanodegree program.
Allows Users to view lists of category-defined posts. Each post has it's own dedicated page with details and comments. New posts can be created; existing posts can be edited or deleted. Comments can also be added, edited or deleted.

Uses React in combo with SemanticUI to create the views.

Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Based on [this project template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).


### Prerequisites

### Installing and Running *IMPORTANT*

Clone the repo and run the command `yarn` or `npm install`.
(NOTE: development was done using Yarn but either should work)

To launch the development server run the command:
```
